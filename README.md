# :surfer: Surfeillance-V2

Welcome to my rewriting of **Surfeillance**! In during our Northcoders Java Bootcamp I took a role focussing primarily on the android frThis was created during my time at the Northcoders Bootcamp and is written in Javaontend. This project is partly to give me a chance to write the backend, and also implement a slightly different featureset.
I have left out the auth, and the idea of logging trips. The function of this is to streamline my repeated browsing of a selection of surf forecasts across a few apps to give me the skinny as to whether there is feasible local surf near me on the horizon.

It showcases various programming concepts and techniques including Test Driven Development (TDD), Object Oriented Programming (OOP), and Functional Programming in Java.
